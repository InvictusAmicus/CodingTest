Requirements for Events.txt

The first integer value in the text file states how many events there are in the file, followed by a comma.
Each event has 3 integer values representing each event's data.
These values are for its id, x position and y position respectively.
These should be separated by a comma, as should each event itself.


Requirements for Ticket.txt

The first integer value in the text file states how many tickets there are in the file, followed by a comma.
Each ticket has two values, one integer and one float value.
These represent the Event id that they are tied to and the price of the ticket respectively.
These values should be separated with a comma, as should the tickets themselves.

      Both of these text files must be in the same directory as the project.

How to run 

Place the four java files in the default package of an Eclipse project.
Add the strings "events.txt" and "tickets.txt" as arguments in the Run Configuration for the Main class.
The SeedDataGenerator can be run separately from the Main class to generate sample text files.
Run the main class and input values as shown.

Assumptions I made

1) Users are unable to make invalid inputs.
2) The program will not need to be scaled up to show a longer list of events close to your area.

How to support multiple events at one co-ordinate

Remove the for loop in isLocationFree(int x, int y).

How to support larger a larger world size

Split the data into groups using a quadtree and only check certain groups depending on the location chosen by the user.
